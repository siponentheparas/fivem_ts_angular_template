# Fivem_TS_Angular_Template
This is a template to quickly set up a project, which uses typescript for scripting and angular for UI development.

## Use
To use this template, press the "Use this template" button and select "Create a new repository".
Or, if you don't want to create a repository, you can just download to source code and start building from there.

You need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to build this project, install it.
After using this template, run pnpm i to install node packages.

Run `pnpm build` to build the whole project. Built files will go to the `dist/` folder.\
Run `pnpm start` to start a development server for the UI.

To use this as a resource in fivem, you need to build the project with `pnpm build`.\
Create a resource folder in your server's resources folder, `myresource/` for example.\
Copy the `dist/` folder and `fxmanifest.lua` file to your `myresource/` folder and start your resource.

Or you can put the whole project into your resources folder and you only need to run `pnpm build`.

## Support
I don't provide support regarding this template or teach you how to use typescript/angular, the internet is full of tutorials and courses for ts/angular.

But I do welcome improvement ideas. You can create an issue or a pull request for those.
