# Fivem_TS_Angular_Template
This is a template to quickly set up a project, which uses typescript for scripting and angular for UI development.

## Use
To use this template, press the "Use this template" button and select "Create a new repository".
Or, if you don't want to create a repository, you can just download to source code and start building from there.

## Support
I don't provide support regarding this template or teach you how to use typescript/angular, the internet is full of tutorial and courses for ts/angular.

But I do welcome improvement ideas. You can create an issue or pull request for those.
